# Introduction to Agricultural Informatics

We will overview current and emerging technologies used in digital agriculture. You will be engaged in learning technology fundamentals (languages, concepts, methods), through seven 2-week projects. These hands-on exercises will allow you to gain a practical understanding of the technology itself, review research and development trends, and debate opportunities and challenges presented by each technology. This course will equip you with basic computational thinking and software development skills for Agricultural Informatics careers.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of informatics challenges in food and agricultural systems.
2. Develop programming skills to create scripts and web applications to explore, store, manipulate, and view food and agriculture data.
3. Develop computational thinking skills to select appropriate informatics approaches and digital technologies to solve a range of challenges in food and agricultural systems.
4. Conceptualize an informatics solution to solving an open food system or agricultural challenge.

## Course Assessments

**6 Quizzes** will be available on Brightspace. They are due at 5pm every alternating Monday starting in Week 2. Quizzes are multiple choice/short answer, and will be auto graded. These are intended to serve as "participation" checks, and hopefully help you evaluate how you're coping with the course. 

**7 Labs** will be available on Github. Each lab is due at the start of the next 2 week module. Each lab will come with submission instructions, but I will generally expect a timestamp of no later than 5pm the day it is due. There will be a 5 hour no-penalty grace period in case you have technical difficulties with submission. 

All parts of the **Project** description and submission instructions are available on Github. Each of the three parts will be evaluated based on a high-level rubric to be provided with the project description.

**Late Policy:** You can have three "late days" where you submit work one business day late with no questions asked. You can use these for quizzes, labs, and projects part 1 & 2. After that, you will be penalised 5% per day late. *The moment you have any issues, please contact me, and we can discuss options.*

# Support & Policies

## Attendance Policy
This course is designed in a hybrid model, with some face-to-face meetings and others completed remotely. UUniversity policy states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. For the purposes of this course, being “present” means attending all face-to-face meetings unless you are ill or need to be absent for reasons excused by University regulations: grief/bereavement, military service, jury duty, parenting leave or certain medically excused absences (go to the [Office of the Dean of Students (ODOS)](https://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absence-policies.html) website for details on how to submit those requests). Being “present” also means participating remotely and completing work assigned for days when we do not meet face-to-face. This work is required to help you meet the course learning outcomes. These times count toward the course contact hours and your course grade. 

That said, life is complicated, and you can contact me if you have any challenges/concerns with attending classes in-person. 

## Academic Guidance in the Event of Quarantine/Isolation
Your health and safety is important. If you must miss class at any point in time during the semester, please reach out to me via email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. For COVID-19 concerns, please see the [Fall 2022: What you need to know guidance published July 27](https://protect.purdue.edu/updates/fall-2022-what-you-need-to-know/). If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser and notify me via email or Brightspace. We will make arrangements based on your particular situation. 

## Accessibility
Purdue University is committed to making learning experiences accessible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability, you are welcome to let me know so that we can discuss options. You are also encouraged to contact the Disability Resource Center at: drc@purdue.edu or by phone: 765-494-1247.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Individuals are encouraged to alert university officials to potential breaches of this value by either emailing integrity@purdue.edu or by calling 765-494-8778. While information may be submitted anonymously, the more information is submitted the greater the opportunity for the university to investigate the concern. More details are available on our course Brightspace table of contents, under University Policies.

Make sure your lab Github repositories are "private" for the duration of the course, to prevent others from simply copying your code. I trust that you will work independently, and will evaluate your work based on your "commit" history (i.e., you should NOT just commit the ENTIRE lab 5 minutes before the deadline). In general, writing code with the help of the internet is permissable, i.e., you can ask questions on Stack Overflow, discuss the problems with each other on Slack. Ultimately, I have a policy in which I trust that you are doing the right thing, unless I see evidence to the contrary.

## Nondiscrimination Statement
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community which recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her potential. In pursuit of its goal of academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity. The University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life. A hyperlink to Purdue’s full Nondiscrimination Policy Statement is included in our course Brightspace under University Policies.
